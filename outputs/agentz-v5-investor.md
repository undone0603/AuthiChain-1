# Agentz v5 — Investor Brief

## The Problem

Counterfeit goods are a **$1.8 trillion** global problem (OECD 2025). Fake pharmaceuticals alone kill over 1 million people annually. Existing solutions — holograms, serial numbers, certificates — are easily forged and impossible to verify at scale.

## The Solution

**AuthiChain** is a blockchain-backed product verification platform. Every product gets a unique on-chain identity (Base L2 / ERC-721) that anyone can verify instantly via QR scan, NFC tap, or API call.

### How It Works

```
Brand registers product → On-chain identity minted (Base L2)
Consumer scans QR/NFC  → Instant verification (<200ms)
API call from platform → Confidence score + blockchain proof
```

## Market Opportunity

| Segment | TAM | AuthiChain Entry Point |
|---------|-----|----------------------|
| Anti-counterfeit packaging | $180B by 2028 | API + NFC verification |
| Product authentication | $4.2B by 2027 | SaaS platform |
| Supply chain traceability | $6.1B by 2028 | Scan history + provenance |
| **Total addressable** | **$190B+** | |

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **API subscriptions** (RapidAPI + direct) — $0–$499/mo per customer
2. **Enterprise contracts** — Custom pricing for 100K+ verifications/mo
3. **Per-verification overage** — $0.01–$0.05 per call above tier limit
4. **Brand onboarding fees** — One-time setup for enterprise integrations

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Price | Verifications | Target |
|------|-------|--------------|--------|
| Basic | Free | 100/mo | Developers, testing |
| Pro | $49/mo | 1,000/mo | Small brands, resellers |
| Ultra | $199/mo | 10,000/mo | Mid-market brands |
| Mega | $499/mo | 100,000/mo | Enterprise, marketplaces |

### Unit Economics (at scale)

- Verification cost: ~$0.001 (Base L2 gas negligible)
- Gross margin: 95%+ on API revenue
- LTV/CAC target: >5x via developer-led growth

## Traction

- Live API with 7 endpoints on RapidAPI marketplace
- Blockchain verification on Base L2 (ERC-721)
- NFC + QR dual-verification capability
- Multi-product checkout (QRON — AI QR code platform generating revenue)
- Stripe billing integration live with subscription management

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15, React, TypeScript |
| Backend | Vercel serverless, Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Blockchain | Base L2, Thirdweb SDK, ERC-721 |
| Payments | Stripe (subscriptions + one-time) |
| AI | FAL.ai (QR code generation) |
| Infrastructure | Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, Supabase |

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Blockchain-native** — Not a database with "blockchain" branding. Actual on-chain proof (Base L2).
2. **Developer-first** — API on RapidAPI, OpenAPI spec, SDKs. Developers adopt before enterprise sales close.
3. **Dual verification** — QR (visual) + NFC (physical). Higher confidence than single-method solutions.
4. **Cost structure** — Base L2 gas is near-zero. 95%+ margins at scale.
5. **Platform play** — QRON (AI QR codes) + AuthiChain (verification) = two products, one ecosystem.

## Team

AuthiChain is built by a technical founding team with experience in blockchain, SaaS, and enterprise software.
