# AuthiChain Marketing & Demo Intake

## Purpose

This document is the internal handbook for the **AuthiChain Marketing & Demo
Intake** pipeline. Every inbound request for a demo, partnership, press
briefing, investor update, or custom industry storymode is collected through
a single Airtable form and triaged from there.

Keeping a single intake surface makes the process measurable, ensures nothing
is lost in email, and lets us feed marketing data directly back into the
demos and economy maps that live in this repository.

## Intake form

All requests must be submitted through the Airtable intake form:

**Form URL:** https://airtable.com/appERlrcb1RcoPdA7/tblVJgLp2K2Rif08B/viwPH8zIn44lFjuc1

Share this link externally in:

- Outbound sales emails
- LinkedIn / X / Telegram bios
- Investor decks (QR code on the last slide)
- The public `/demos` page “Book a demo” CTA
- Conference and trade-show hand-outs

## Instructions for internal use

1. **Triage daily.** The marketing lead reviews new intake submissions every
   morning and assigns an owner within Airtable.
2. **Tag by industry** using the same labels found in
   [`demo-mapping.md`](./demo-mapping.md) (pharma, cannabis, luxury,
   collectibles, supply chain, etc.). This keeps the demo requests aligned
   with the demos that actually exist in `app/demos/*`.
3. **Link to the matching demo.** When an inbound request lands for an
   industry that already has a demo, reply with the direct demo URL (for
   example `https://authichain.com/demos/pharma`).
4. **Escalate custom demos.** If the request requires a brand-specific
   storymode or manifest entry, create a follow-up task for engineering and
   reference the entry in `outputs/storymode-demo-manifest.json` that will
   be added.
5. **Close the loop.** Mark the Airtable record as “Delivered” only after
   the prospect has received either a live demo, a recorded walkthrough, or
   the requested marketing asset.
6. **Never share raw data externally.** The Airtable base is
   for internal use only — do not export or forward submitter details
   without written approval from the marketing lead.
