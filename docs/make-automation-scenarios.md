# Make.com Automation Scenarios for Business Operations

This document outlines the four Make.com scenarios for automating AuthiChain/QRON business operations as described in issue #20.

## Overview

The automation suite covers the full lifecycle of contract deployments, tokenomics management, data analytics, and operations. Each scenario is composed of a series of modules in Make.com that orchestrate external services such as GitHub, Hardhat, Airtable, Slack, Stripe and internal APIs.

### Scenario 1 – Contracts (Smart Contract Lifecycle)

Modules:

- **GitHub Webhook Trigger** – fires on contract-related commits to the repository.
- **Hardhat Deployment Runner** – executes deployment scripts to deploy smart contracts to the configured network.
- **Contract Address Parser** – extracts deployed addresses and metadata from deployment output.
- **Airtable Logger** – writes contract details to the Contracts table in the Airtable base.
- **Slack Notification** – posts deployment status messages to the #dev-deploys channel.

### Scenario 2 – Tokenomics (Revenue & Fee Distribution)

Modules:

- **Stripe/Web3 Revenue Listener** – captures revenue events and QRON swaps.
- **Fee Router** – splits revenue into burn, security, AI, and treasury allocations.
- **Airtable Fee Logger** – records fee flows and QRON swaps in the Fee Flows table.
- **Swap/Burn Executor** – interacts with on-chain contracts to perform swaps and burns.
- **Slack Summary** – sends daily revenue summaries to #finance.

### Scenario 3 – Data (Truth Graph & Analytics)

Modules:

- **Product Verification Trigger** – listens for product verification and scan events.
- **Analytics Processor** – aggregates scans, verifications, and story data to build a truth graph.
- **AI Story Builder** – calls the AI service to generate workflows, stories, and classifications.
- **Airtable Updater** – updates the Products table with confidence scores, workflows, stories and features.
- **Dashboard Exporter** – makes processed analytics available to the dashboard via the API.

### Scenario 4 – Operations (Onboarding, Billing & Support)

Modules:

- **Brand Onboarding Intake** – handles new brand sign‑ups, storing them in the Brands table and creating initial subscription records.
- **Billing Automation** – interfaces with Stripe to manage subscriptions, trials, and renewals.
- **Support Ticket Sync** – syncs incoming support tickets from Intercom/Zendesk into the Support Tickets table.
- **Churn/High‑Value Alerts** – triggers Slack alerts for churn risk or high‑value enterprise sign‑ups.
- **Report Generation** – compiles operational metrics and exports them to QuickBooks/Xero.

These blueprints serve as a starting point for implementing Make.com workflows that automate and streamline AuthiChain’s operational processes.
